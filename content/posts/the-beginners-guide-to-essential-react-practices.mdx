Are you looking to create a robust React application using Next.js? Next.js is a powerful framework for developing React applications quickly and efficiently. In this article, we'll cover the basics of Next.js and how to create a robust React app using this framework.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework developed and maintained by Vercel. It allows developers to create React applications with minimal setup and configuration. It includes features such as server-side rendering, code splitting, and hot-reloading, making it ideal for building fast and performant applications.

## How to Get Started with Next.js

Getting started with Next.js is simple. All you need to do is install the `next` package from npm.

```
npm install next
```

Once you've installed the `next` package, you can create a new project with the `create-next-app` command.

```
npx create-next-app
```

This command will create a new directory with the necessary files and dependencies to get started with your Next.js project.

## How to Create a Robust React App Using Next.js

Now that you have a basic Next.js project set up, it's time to start building your robust React app. Here are some tips to help you get started:

### Use React Hooks

React hooks are a great way to manage state in your React application. They allow you to write clean and concise code that is easy to maintain.

### Use a Styling Library

Using a styling library such as Emotion or Styled Components will help you keep your styles organized and consistent. It will also make it easier to customize the look and feel of your application.

### Use Server-side Rendering

Server-side rendering allows your application to render the HTML on the server before it is sent to the client. This improves the performance of your application, as the client does not have to wait for the HTML to be generated on the client-side.

### Use Code Splitting

Code splitting allows you to split your application into multiple bundles, which can be loaded asynchronously. This reduces the initial load time of your application, as it only has to download the necessary bundles for the page.

### Use Hot Reloading

Hot reloading allows you to make changes to your code and see the result in real-time without having to refresh the page. This is a great way to speed up your development time.

### Use TypeScript

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. Using TypeScript can help you catch errors earlier and write more maintainable code.

## Conclusion

In this article, we covered how to create a robust React app using Next.js. We discussed tips such as using React hooks, a styling library, server-side rendering, code splitting, hot reloading, and TypeScript.

If you're looking to build a robust React application, Next.js is a great option. With its features and capabilities, it makes it easy to create performant and maintainable applications.
