Next.js is a powerful and popular framework for building modern web applications. It is built on top of React and is designed to make it easy to create high-performance and reliable web applications. In this guide, we will look at how to get started with Next.js and learn some of the basics of the framework.

## Installation

The first step to using Next.js is to install it. This can be done with either the `npm` package manager or the `yarn` package manager.

For `npm`, run the following command:

```
npm install next
```

For `yarn`, run the following command:

```
yarn add next
```

## Creating Your First App

Now that you have Next.js installed, it is time to create your first app. To do this, create a directory for your project and run the `create-next-app` command.

```
npx create-next-app my-app
```

This will create a new directory with the name `my-app` and will contain all the necessary files for your app.

## Basic Concepts

There are a few basic concepts that you need to be aware of when working with Next.js. 

The first is the **pages** directory. This directory is where you will store all the pages for your application. Each page is a React component and will be rendered when the corresponding URL is visited.

The second concept is **routing**. This is how you decide which page will be rendered for a given URL. In Next.js, routing is handled by the `pages/_app.js` file. 

The third concept is **data fetching**. This is how you retrieve data from an external source and make it available to your application. In Next.js, this can be done with the `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps` methods.

## Building Your App

Now that you have a basic understanding of the concepts behind Next.js, it is time to build your app. You will do this by creating components and adding them to the pages directory.

For example, if you wanted to create a page that displays a list of posts, you would create a `Posts.js` component and add it to the `pages` directory. This component would then be rendered when the `/posts` URL is visited.

You can also create components that are shared across multiple pages, such as a `Header` component. These components can be stored in the `components` directory.

## Deploying Your App

Once you have built your app, you will need to deploy it so that it can be accessed by others. Next.js supports a variety of deployment options, such as Vercel and Netlify.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we have looked at how to get started with Next.js. We have discussed the basics of the framework and how to create and deploy an app using Next.js.
