Are you an intermediate Python programmer looking to take your coding to the next level? If so, then you'll want to become familiar with the various control structures that Python has to offer. Control structures allow you to control the flow of your code, allowing you to create more complex programs. In this blog post, we'll discuss the different control structures that are available in Python, with code examples and official Python references.

## For Loops

The most common control structure in Python is the **for loop**. The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence or collection of items. For example, to print out the numbers 1 to 10, we can use a for loop like this:

```python
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
```

This code will print out the numbers 1 to 10. The `range()` function is used to specify the range of numbers to iterate over.

## While Loops

Another common control structure is the **while loop**. While loops are used to execute a block of code until a certain condition is met. For example, to print out the numbers 1 to 10, we can use a while loop like this:

```python
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

This code will print out the numbers 1 to 10. The variable `i` is used to keep track of the number that is currently being printed.

## If Statements

The **if statement** is used to check if a certain condition is met. If the condition is true, then a block of code will be executed. For example, to print out "Hello World" if the number is greater than 5, we can use an if statement like this:

```python
if number > 5:
    print("Hello World")
```

This code will print out "Hello World" if the variable `number` is greater than 5.

## Break and Continue

The **break** and **continue** statements are used to control the flow of the loop. The break statement is used to exit the loop, while the continue statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the loop and move on to the next iteration. For example, to print out the numbers 1 to 10 except for 5, we can use a for loop with break and continue like this:

```python
for i in range(1, 11):
    if i == 5:
        continue
    print(i)
```

This code will print out the numbers 1 to 10 except for 5.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we discussed the different control structures that are available in Python. We looked at for loops, while loops, if statements, break and continue statements. Understanding these control structures is essential for becoming a more advanced Python programmer.
