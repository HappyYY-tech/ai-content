Are you interested in getting started with Next.js? It's a powerful JavaScript framework that can help you create amazing web applications quickly. This tutorial will walk you through the basics of Next.js, from installation to creating a simple page. By the end of this guide, you'll have a basic understanding of how to use Next.js to create a web application. 

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is an open-source, production-ready React.js framework that enables developers to quickly create web applications with server-side rendering. With Next.js, developers can create websites, web applications, and more with the power of React and the simplicity of Next.js.

## Installing Next.js

Before you can get started, you'll need to install Next.js. To do this, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed. Once that's done, you can use npm to install Next.js. Open up a terminal and run the following command:

```
npm install next
```

Next.js will now be installed in your project directory.

## Creating a Page

Now that you have Next.js installed, you can start creating pages. To create a page, you'll need to create a new file in your project directory. The file should be named `index.js` and should include the following code:

```js
import React from 'react'
import { NextPage } from 'next'

const Home: NextPage = () => {
  return <div>Hello, world!</div>
}

export default Home
```

This code creates a new React component that will be rendered as the homepage of your website.

## Adding Routes

Now that you have a page, you'll need to create routes. Routes are what tell Next.js what page to render when a user visits a certain URL. To do this, you'll need to create a `routes.js` file in your project directory and add the following code:

```js
import Home from './pages/index'

const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    component: Home
  }
]

export default routes
```

This code defines a single route that renders the `Home` component when a user visits the homepage. You can add additional routes as needed.

## Adding Styling

Finally, you'll need to add styling to your page. To do this, you'll need to install a CSS preprocessor such as SASS or LESS and create a `styles.scss` file in your project directory. You can then add styling to your page by importing the stylesheet in your `index.js` file:

```js
import React from 'react'
import { NextPage } from 'next'
import './styles.scss'

const Home: NextPage = () => {
  return <div>Hello, world!</div>
}

export default Home
```

Now you're ready to start adding styling to your page.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you've learned the basics of Next.js, from installation to creating a simple page. With Next.js, you can quickly create web applications with server-side rendering. For more information on Next.js, check out the [official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs).
