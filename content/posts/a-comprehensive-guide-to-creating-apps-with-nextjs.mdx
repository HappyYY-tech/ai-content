Next.js is a popular JavaScript framework for creating fast, reactive, and SEO-friendly web applications and websites. It is an open-source framework created by Vercel and is used by many large companies such as Uber, Twitter, and Airbnb.

In this article, we'll go over the basics of Next.js and how to get started with it. We'll cover topics such as setting up your development environment, creating a basic Next.js application, and deploying your application.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

The first step in getting started with Next.js is to set up your development environment. You'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can install them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you'll need to install the Next.js CLI (command-line interface) tool. This tool will allow you to create and manage your Next.js projects. To install the CLI, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install -g next
```

## Creating a Basic Next.js Application

Now that you have your development environment set up, you can create a new Next.js application. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

```
next init
```

This will create a new Next.js project in the current directory. The project will contain a `package.json` file, a `pages` directory, and a `public` directory.

## Deploying Your Application

Next.js comes with built-in support for deploying your application to a variety of hosting providers. You can deploy your application to Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, and more.

To deploy your application to Vercel, you'll need to create an account and log in. Once you're logged in, run the following command in your terminal:

```
vercel
```

This will deploy your application to Vercel and provide you with a URL where you can access your application.
